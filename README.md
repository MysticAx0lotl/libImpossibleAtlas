# libImpossibleAtlas
 A C++ library to manipulate spritemaps (aka Atlases) for The Impossible Game

Features
- Load spritemap from .bin
- All individual "fragments" get loaded to easily modifiable nodes
- Full support for every kind of data found in an atlas file
- Export as both .bin and XML

Future plans
- Load XML directly
- Calculate "real" coordinates (coords in the atlas format are percentages, not pixel coords)
